    "actionable data about their rapidly changing communities from the once-every-ten-years Census, started to look for\n",
    "ways to get more immediate information about the people in their districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn't until the 1990s, however, that plans to get more frequent Census-type data came to fruition. Congress, seeing a drop in\n",
    "Census response rates as a result of its burdensome length, directed the U.S. Census Bureau to develop different ways to get the\n",
    "much needed information. The U.S. Census Bureau, in concert with statisticians from other organizations, eventually developed a\n",
